# Animate Reactor

A component that makes Animate.css a React Component

[![npm package][npm-badge]][npm]

Animate Reactor created to animate things with power of Animate.css. To use this component effectively, have a look this [animation list](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css#user-content-animations).

## Install

### With NPM

`npm install animate-reactor`

### With Yarn

`yarn add animate-reactor`

## Usage

```javascript
import Animate from 'animate-reactor'

const Component = () => {
  return (
    <Animate enter="shakeX" delay={3} speed="faster">
      Shake Me!
    </Animate>
  )
}
```

## Enter and Exit

Animate Reactor can get two animation which triggers after each other. Which means, you can have a **simple** timeline with this. See on example.

```javascript
<Animate enter="fadeIn" exit="fadeOut">
  Welcome and Good bye
</Animate>
```

## Endless Animation

To create an endless animation use `infinite` prop.

```javascript
<Animate enter="shake" infinite>
  Endless Shake!
</Animate>
```

An **important** note. If you use infinite prop, `exit, onEnterEnd, onEachEnd` props will be disabled since the enter animation never ends. This is not an Animate Reactor bug. This is a part of nature of CSS Animations.

If you want animation run certain times, use `repeat` prop instead. Unlike `infinite`, all props will be available to use. Includes `exit, onEnterEnd, onEachEnd`.

```javascript
<Animate enter="heartBeat" repeat={3}>
  Beat three times and stop!
</Animate>
```

## Power of callbacks

Animate Reactor let your callbacks have a place on each part of the animation process.

```javascript
<Animate
  enter="bounce"
  exit="flash"
  onEachAction={() => console.log('Something happened')}
  onEachStart={() => console.log('Something started')}
  onEachEnd={() => console.log('Something ended')}
  onEnterStart={() => console.log('Enter animation started')}
  onEnterEnd={() => console.log('Enter animation ended')}
  onExitStart={() => console.log('Exit animation started')}
  onExitEnd={() => console.log('Exit animation ended')}>
  Endless Shake!
</Animate>
```

## Custom CSS Support

You can get support of CSS to make your animations even stronger.

```javascript
<Animate
  enter="bounce"
  style={{
    animationDelay: '10s',
    animationDuration: '1s',
    animationTimingFunction: 'ease-in-out',
  }}>
  I am powered by CSS.
</Animate>
```
